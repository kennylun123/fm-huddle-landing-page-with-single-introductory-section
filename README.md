## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CUBE CSS

### What I learned

- CUBE methodology
- The width of an img element can be affected by the width of its parent elements, any CSS rules applied to the img element itself, and any width attribute defined on the img element.
```html
<div class="flex">
  <div class="flex_item1">
    <!-- Wrap the img element with a div to avoid width overlarge -->
    <img src="" alt="">
  </div>

  <div class="flex_item2">

  </div>
</div>
```
